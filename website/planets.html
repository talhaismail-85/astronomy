                   <P class="text-dark">The planets in our solar system are:
                
                   <h5><b>Mercury:</b></h5> <p>The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is a small, rocky planet with a very thin atmosphere. It has a surface marked by craters and has extreme temperature fluctuations.</p>
                    
                    <h5><b>Venus:</b></h5><p> Similar in size and structure to Earth but radically different in atmosphere, Venus is known for its thick, toxic atmosphere which traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.</p> 
                    <br>
                   <h5><b> Earth:</b></h5><p> The third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. Earth has a diverse environment and atmosphere, consisting mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.</p>
                    
                  <h5><b>Mars:</b></h5><p> Often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, Mars has the largest volcano and the deepest, longest canyon in the solar system. It has a thin atmosphere and is a focus of ongoing research into the possibility of past or present life.</p>
                    
                  <h5><b>Jupiter:</b></h5><p> The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a gas giant with a massive atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a famous Great Red Spot, a giant storm bigger than Earth, and a strong magnetic field.</p> 
                    
                   <h5><b>Saturn:</b></h5><p>Known for its stunning rings, Saturn is a gas giant with the most spectacular ring system of any planet in our solar system. These rings are made up of ice, rock, and dust.</p> 
                    
                  <h5><b>Uranus:</b></h5><p> An ice giant with a blue-green color due to methane in its atmosphere, Uranus is unique for its tilted axis, which causes it to rotate on its side.</p>
                    
                   <h5><b>Neptune:</b></h5><p> The furthest known planet from the Sun, Neptune is an ice giant with a deep blue color, also due to atmospheric methane. It has the strongest winds in the solar system.</p>
                    
                    These eight planets are recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The list used to include Pluto, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.
                </P>
                <BR>
                   <h4><b>SO, WHAT IS (AND ISN'T) A PLANET</b></h4>
                   <p>A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star (like the Sun) and has certain specific characteristics according to the definition set by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). According to the IAU, which is the globally recognized authority for naming and defining celestial bodies, a planet must meet the following criteria:

                    It must orbit a star (in our solar system, this star is the Sun).
                    It must be massive enough for its gravity to have shaped it into a round (spherical) shape.
                    It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. This means it is gravitationally dominant and there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its moons or those in stable orbits (like trojan asteroids).</p>
               <p>Anything that does not meet these criteria is not considered a planet. This includes:</p>
               <li>Dwarf Planets: These are similar to planets but do not meet the third criterion. They have not cleared their neighboring region of other objects. Pluto is the most famous example of a dwarf planet.</li>
               <li>Moons: Also known as natural satellites, moons are bodies that orbit planets or dwarf planets, not the Sun directly.</li>
               <li>Asteroids: These are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun. Most are found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.</li>
               <li>Comets: These are composed of ice and dust and typically have highly elliptical orbits, taking them far out into the solar system and then back towards the Sun.</li>
               <li>Stars, Black Holes, and Other Stellar Objects: These are entirely different types of celestial objects and do not fit the criteria for planets.</li>
               <br>
               <p>The reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 is a well-known example of the application of these criteria. Pluto was reclassified because it does not clear its orbit of other debris, thus failing the third criterion.</p>

                <p>Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is also known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum. Mercury is a heavy, silvery d-block element that is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. It is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, fluorescent lamps, and other devices, though its use has diminished in response to environmental concerns.Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and its rocky body is similar in appearance to the Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and its surface is marked by craters and rugged terrain similar to the Moon.In Roman mythology, Mercury is the god of commerce, messages/communication, travelers, and boundaries, known for his speed and swiftness.</p>

                                    <p><h5>A. DISCOVERY</h5> 
                                        <P> Mercury has been known since ancient times because it is visible to the naked eye. It is named after the Roman messenger god because of its speedy movement across the sky. Due to its visibility without the need for telescopes, it's impossible to attribute its discovery to a single individual or a specific date.</P>
                                         
                                         <h5>B. SIZE</h5>
                                        <P> Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. Its diameter is about 4,879 kilometers (3,032 miles), making it only slightly larger than the Earth's Moon​​.</P>
                                         
                                        <h5> C. Atmosphere</h5>
                                        <P> Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, often referred to as an exosphere, made up of atoms blasted off its surface by solar radiation and solar wind. It contains oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This "atmosphere" is not stable—atoms are continuously lost to space and replenished from the surface​​​​.</p>P>
                                         
                                       <h5>  D. DISTANCE FROM THE SUN & EARTH</h5>
                                        <P> From the Sun: Mercury orbits at an average distance of about 58 million kilometers (36 million miles) from the Sun, which is approximately 39% of the distance between the Earth and the Sun​​.
                                         From the Earth: The distance between Mercury and Earth varies depending on both planets' positions in their orbits. The closest approach (perihelion) is about 77 million kilometers (48 million miles), and the farthest distance (aphelion) can be 
                                         up to 222 million kilometers (138 million miles).</P>
                                         <li>Orbital Period: Mercury completes an orbit around the Sun in about 88 Earth days​</li>
                                         <li>Rotational Period: Mercury's day (one complete rotation on its axis) is about 58.6 Earth days</li>
                                         <li>Temperature Range: Surface temperatures can range from as low as -173°C (-280°F) at night to as high as 427°C (800°F) during the day due to its thin atmosphere and proximity to the Sun​</li>
                                         <li>Geological Features: Mercury's surface is heavily cratered, similar to the Moon, indicating it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Notable features include the Caloris Basin, a giant impact crater, and "weird terrain," an area opposite the basin marked by hilly, anomalous terrain</li>
                                         <li>Magnetic Field: Despite its small size, Mercury has a significant, albeit weak, magnetic field, about 1% the strength of Earth's. This suggests it has a partially molten core</li>

                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor in the solar system. It's one of the four terrestrial planets, meaning it has a solid, rocky surface, much like Earth's. However, in many ways, Venus is significantly different from Earth and is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. Here are some key aspects about Venus.Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making the planet's surface pressure 90 times that of Earth. This extreme greenhouse effect creates the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system, reaching up to 465 degrees Celsius (869 degrees Fahrenheit), which is hot enough to melt lead. The surface of Venus is a dry desertscape, with vast plains, highland regions, and a few large mountains, but no liquid water.  It's scattered with volcanoes (some potentially still active) and features such as large lava plains. </p>

                                     <h5>A. WHEN DISCOVER</h5>                
                                    <P> Venus has been known since ancient times because of its visibility to the naked eye in the Earth's sky. It is not credited with a discovery by a single individual due to its prominence in various ancient cultures worldwide, being known to both ancient astronomers and civilizations for thousands of years.</P>
                                        
                                       <h5>B. SIZE</h5>
                                       <P> Venus has a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles), making it only slightly smaller than Earth, which has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles). This similarity in size has contributed to its nickname as Earth’s sister.</P>
                                        
                                       <h5>C. ATMOSPHERE</h5>
                                       <P> The atmosphere of Venus is incredibly dense and is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it highly reflective. This thick atmosphere generates the most extreme example of the greenhouse effect in the Solar System, with surface temperatures averaging around 465°C (869°F). The atmospheric pressure at the surface is about 92 times that of Earth's, equivalent to the pressure found 900 meters (3,000 feet) underwater on Earth.</P>
                                        
                                        <h5>D. DISTANCE FROM SUN & EARTH</h5>
                                      <P>  Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles). The distance between Venus and Earth varies depending on their positions in their orbits. The closest approach (inferior conjunction) can bring Venus and Earth within about 40 million kilometers (25 million miles) of each other.</P>
                                      <li>Surface Conditions: The surface of Venus is rocky and volcanic with a landscape that includes vast plains, highland regions, and tens of thousands of volcanoes, some of which are thought to have been active in the recent past</li>
                                      <li>Rotation: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets in the Solar System, including Earth. This retrograde rotation means that on Venus, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east. A day on Venus (one complete rotation on its axis) lasts longer than a Venusian year (one complete orbit around the Sun).</li>
                                      <li>Exploration: Venus has been explored by numerous spacecraft, including NASA’s Magellan, which mapped the planet's surface with radar, and ESA’s Venus Express, which studied its atmosphere and surface conditions. The Soviet Venera program in the 1970s and 1980s achieved the first successful robotic landings on the surface, sending back images and data.</li>
                                      <li>Potential for Life: The extreme conditions on Venus' surface are hostile to life as we know it. However, in 2020, researchers announced the detection of phosphine, a gas often associated with biological processes, in Venus' atmosphere, sparking interest in the possibility of aerial microbial life in the planet's upper cloud layers. This discovery has led to calls for future missions to investigate the planet's habitability potential further.</li>

<p>Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. It's a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, featuring surface characteristics reminiscent both of the Moon and the Earth.Mars has a very thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. The Martian climate features large temperature variations, with temperatures ranging from about -195 degrees Fahrenheit (-125 degrees Celsius) during winter at the poles to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) at midday near the equator. The thin atmosphere allows for the existence of the largest dust storms in the solar system, which can cover the entire planet and last for months.The surface of Mars is dry and covered with red iron oxide dust and rocks. It has both the highest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the deepest, longest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the Solar System. </p>

                    <h5>A. WHEN DISCOVER</h5>
<P> Like Venus, Mars has been observed in the night sky for thousands of years by ancient civilizations and therefore does not have a recorded "discovery" date. Its movements were charted by astronomers from the Babylonians to the ancient Greeks and beyond, making it a prominent object of study in the development of astronomy.</P>
<h5>B. SIZE</h5>
<P> Mars has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles), making it roughly half the size of Earth. This smaller size contributes to its lesser gravity, about 38% of Earth's gravity, affecting the ability of the planet to retain a thick atmosphere.</P>
<h5>C. ATMOSPHERE</h5>
<P> The Martian atmosphere is thin and composed mainly of carbon dioxide (about 95.3%), with traces of nitrogen, argon, oxygen, and water vapor. The thin atmosphere contributes to significant temperature variations, with average surface temperatures around -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-60 degrees Celsius), and allows for the presence of dust storms that can envelop the entire planet.</P>
<h5>D. DISTANCE FROM SUN & EARTH</h5>
Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles). The distance between Mars and Earth varies greatly due to their orbits, ranging from approximately 54.6 million kilometers (33.9 million miles) at their closest approach to about 401 million kilometers (249 million miles) when they are on opposite sides of the Sun.
<li>Surface Features: Mars' surface is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the longest canyon, Valles Marineris. Its surface shows evidence of water flow in the past, with river valleys, lake beds, and deltas suggesting that liquid water was once more abundant.</li>
<li>Water Ice: Mars has polar ice caps composed of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice). Subsurface ice has also been detected, and recent findings suggest liquid water may persist in underground lakes beneath the polar ice caps.</li>
<li>Moons: Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, believed to be captured asteroids. These moons are irregular in shape and much smaller than Earth's moon.</li>
<li>Exploration: Mars is a primary target for space exploration. Robotic missions, including rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance, have explored its surface, while orbiters study the planet from above. These missions seek to uncover the planet's past habitability and the potential for past or present life.</li>
<li>Human Exploration: Mars is a focal point for future human exploration, with missions planned by various space agencies and private companies. The challenges of long-duration spaceflight, life support, and surface habitation are subjects of ongoing research and testing.</li>

<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest in the Solar System. It's a gas giant, meaning it doesn't have a solid surface like Earth does. Jupiter is known for its prominent features, including the Great Red Spot, a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years, and its striking system of rings and moons. Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar in composition to the Sun. It has a dense core of heavier elements, but this core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an exotic form of hydrogen that behaves like an electrical conductor. This layer is encased in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.Jupiter's atmosphere is famous for its colorful bands and zones, created by strong east-west winds in the planet's upper atmosphere. The Great Red Spot is the most notable feature, a vast storm that has been observed for over 400 years.  Jupiter also exhibits other storms and cloud patterns, including white ovals and brown barges.</p>

                    <h5>A. WHEN DISCOVER</h5>
<p>Jupiter has been observed for thousands of years by ancient civilizations. Its discovery predates recorded history, so it's impossible to attribute its discovery to a single individual or date.</p>
<h5>B. SIZE</h5>
<p>Jupiter has a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles), making it the largest planet in the solar system. Its massive size means that Jupiter is about 318 times as massive as Earth.</p>
<h5>C. ATMOSPHERE</h5>
<p>The atmosphere of Jupiter is mostly hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (nearly 10%), with trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other compounds. The planet is famous for its Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm system larger than Earth that has raged for at least 400 years.</p>
<h5>D. DISTANCE FROM SUN & EARTH</h5>
<p>Jupiter orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 778 million kilometers (484 million miles), or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU). The distance between Jupiter and Earth varies depending on their positions in their orbits, ranging from approximately 588 million kilometers (365 million miles) at opposition to about 968 million kilometers (601 million miles) when they are on opposite sides of the Sun.</p>
<li>Moons: Jupiter has a vast system of moons, with at least 79 known, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede (the largest moon in the solar system), and Callisto.</li>
<li>Magnetic Field: Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the solar system, created by the motion of metallic hydrogen inside its core. This magnetic field captures particles, creating intense radiation belts.</li>
<li>Rings: Jupiter has a faint ring system composed mainly of dust particles from its moons. These rings were discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft.</li>
<li>Internal Structure: Despite being a gas giant, Jupiter does not have a well-defined solid surface. Its atmosphere gradually transitions into liquid and metallic hydrogen around a dense core, which may be rocky.</li>
<li>Exploration: Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions, and more extensively studied by the Galileo orbiter. The Juno spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in July 2016, is currently studying the planet's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.</li>

                <P>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is notable for its unique characteristics among the planets in our Solar System. It is an ice giant, with a composition distinct from the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its rotational axis is tilted at an angle of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially orbits the Sun on its side. This extreme tilt results in unique seasonal variations, with each pole getting around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a higher presence of "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane compared to Jupiter and Saturn. The methane in the upper atmosphere absorbs red light, giving Uranus its distinctive blue-green color. The planet's interior is made up of an icy mantle surrounded by a rocky core. Uranus has a faint ring system, discovered in 1977. </P>

                                    <P>Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles), making it the third-largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the fourth-largest by mass.</P>
                                    <h5>C. ATMOSPHERE</h5>
                                    <P>The atmosphere of Uranus is primarily composed of hydrogen (83%) and helium (15%), with a small amount of methane (2%). The methane in Uranus's upper atmosphere absorbs red light, giving the planet its characteristic blue-green color. The atmosphere also contains layers of clouds and haze, much of which is water, ammonia, and methane ice crystals.</P>
                                    <h5>D. DISTANCE FROM SUN & EARTH</h5>
                                    <P>Uranus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 2.87 billion kilometers (1.78 billion miles), or 19.2 Astronomical Units (AU). The distance between Uranus and Earth varies significantly throughout their orbits, ranging from approximately 2.6 billion kilometers (1.6 billion miles) at their closest to over 3 billion kilometers (1.86 billion miles) at their farthest.</P>
                                    <li>Axial Tilt: One of Uranus's most distinctive features is its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially orbits the Sun on its side. This unique tilt causes extreme seasonal variations, with each pole getting around 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.</li>
                                    <li>Rings: Uranus has a faint ring system, discovered in 1977. The rings are fewer and darker compared to Saturn's, composed mainly of large particles in narrow, dusty rings.</li>
                                    <li>Moons: Uranus has 27 known moons, named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The largest moons are Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.</li>
                                    <li>Internal Structure: Uranus's interior is primarily composed of ices (water, ammonia, and methane), overlying a rocky core. Unlike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus does not have a significant internal heat source, emitting very little heat into space.</li>
                                    <li>Exploration: Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1986. The flyby provided a wealth of data about Uranus's rings, moons, and atmosphere.</li>

                                <P>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet by diameter and the third-largest by mass. Neptune, an ice giant, is notable for its striking blue color, driven by the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere.Neptune was the first planet to be discovered through mathematical predictions rather than through regular observation. Its existence was predicted by Urbain Le Verrier, and it was subsequently observed by Johann Galle in 1846. This discovery was a remarkable validation of Newton's laws of gravitation.Neptune orbits the Sun at a distance of about 30.1 astronomical units (AU), taking approximately 164.8 Earth years to complete one orbit.. Because of this vast distance, it's not visible to the naked eye and can only be seen with a telescope</P>

                                <h5>A. WHEN DISCOVER</h5>
                                <P>Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846, by Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest, based on predictions by Urbain Le Verrier. The predictions were made to explain irregularities in Uranus's orbit, suggesting the presence of another, farther planet exerting gravitational influence.</P>
                                <h5>B. SIZE</h5>
                                <P>Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), making it the fourth-largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the third-largest by mass.</P>
                                <h5>C. ATMOSPHERE</h5>
                                <P>Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen (80%) and helium (19%), with trace amounts of methane, which gives the planet its characteristic deep blue color. The atmosphere contains dynamic weather systems and the highest wind speeds in the solar system, reaching up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour).</P>
                                <h5>D. DISTANCE FROM SUN & EARTH</h5>
                                <P>Neptune orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles), or 30.1 Astronomical Units (AU). The distance between Neptune and Earth varies significantly due to the planets' orbits, ranging from approximately 4.3 billion kilometers (2.7 billion miles) at their closest approach to over 4.6 billion kilometers (2.9 billion miles) at their farthest.</P>
                                <li>Moons: Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most notable. Triton is unique among large moons in the solar system for its retrograde orbit, indicating it was likely captured by Neptune's gravity rather than forming in place.</li>
                                <li>Rings: Neptune has a series of faint rings composed of dust particles thought to be made of ice coated with silicates or carbon-based material. The rings are not uniform, with thick clumps of material in some sections.</li>
                                <li>Internal Structure: Neptune's interior is believed to consist of a core of rock and metal, surrounded by a mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices, overlaid by the atmosphere. The planet radiates more than twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun, indicating an internal heat source.</li>
                                <li>Magnetic Field: Like Uranus, Neptune has a peculiarly oriented magnetic field, which is tilted at a significant angle from its rotational axis and offset from the planet's center.</li>
                                <li>Exploration: Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, during its flyby in 1986. The encounter provided invaluable data about Neptune's atmosphere, rings, moons, and magnetic field.</li>
